# Techonologies

## Overview

### Front End

I use ***React*** to render UI components. For state management, I apply ***Redux*** to store current logined user info, blogs info, etc. For form parsing and validation, I utilize ***Yup*** to create form schemas, and ***Formik*** to validate inputs.

***Npm*** is used for package management.

***Cypress*** is used for automatic testing

***Bootstrap*** for UI style

### Backend

I use ***Express*** as backend server, ***MongoDB-Mongoose*** as database. To protect user info, I use ***bcrypt*** to encrypt data. 

***Jest*** is used for testing server's response, and ***Morgan*** is for logging as debug tools.

### Deployment

I deployed the application on ***Heroku***, the website is https://junshengtan-blog-app.herokuapp.com
